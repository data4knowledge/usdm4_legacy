The Sponsor intends to enroll approximately 450 patients that have been diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and meet the entry criteria in centers globally.</p><p>Patients must be at least 18 years of age with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection per WHO criteria, including a positive PCR of any specimen (e.g., respiratory, blood, urine, stool, other bodily fluid).  At the time of enrollment, patients must have SpO2 \uf0a3 93% or PaO2/FiO2 \uf03c 300 mmHg despite being on SOC, which may include anti-viral treatment, low dose steroids, and supportive care.</p><p>Patients in whom, in the opinion of the treating physician, progression to death is imminent and inevitable within the next 24 hours, irrespective of the provision of treatments, will be excluded from the study.  Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) or suspected active bacterial, fungal, viral, or other infection (besides COVID-19) will be excluded from the study.</p><p>Patients will be randomized as soon as possible after screening at a 2:1 ratio to receive blinded treatment of either TCZ or a matching placebo, respectively.  Study treatment must be given in combination with SOC.  The randomization will be stratified by geographic region (North America and Europe) and mechanical ventilation (yes, no).  The proportion of patients who are on a mechanical ventilator at the time of randomization will be capped at no more than 50% of the overall study population.</p><p>Patients assigned to the TCZ arm will receive one infusion of TCZ 8 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 800 mg, and patients assigned to the placebo arm will receive one infusion of placebo, both in addition to SOC.</p><p>For both arms, if the clinical signs or symptoms worsen or do not improve (reflected by sustained fever or at least a one-category worsening on the 7-category ordinal scale of clinical status), one additional infusion of blinded treatment of TCZ or placebo can be given, 8-24 hours after the initial infusion.</p><p>Patients who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may qualify for one re-screening opportunity (for a total of 2 screenings per participant) at the investigator's discretion.  Patients are not required to re-sign the consent form if they are re-screened within 7 days after previously signing the consent form.</p><p>The study assessments to be conducted include the following: physical examination, vital signs, oxygen saturation, assessment of consciousness, presence and absence of respiratory support, adverse events, concomitant therapies, clinical laboratory tests, and nasopharyngeal swabs.</p><p>Patients will be followed up for a total of 60 days after first dose of study medication.</p><p>If patients are discharged from hospital prior to Day 28, follow up visits should occur twice weekly through Day 28.  Patients are encouraged to return for onsite visits at least weekly if possible; other follow-up visits may be conducted by telephone or home visits.  Patients should return to the site for a Day 28 visit.  After Day 28, all patients should have follow up visits on Day 35, Day 45, and Day 60; the Day 35 and Day 45 visits may be conducted by telephone or by home visits for discharged patients, while the Day 60 visit should be conducted onsite.</p><p>During the study, standard supportive care will be given according to clinical practice.</p><h2>Number of Patients</h2><p>This study aims to enroll approximately 450 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.</p><h2>Target Population</h2><h2>Inclusion Criteria</h2><p>Patients must meet the following criteria for study entry:</p><ul>\n<li>\uf0b7 Signed Informed Consent Form by any patient capable of giving consent, or, when the patient is not capable of giving consent, by his or her legal/authorized representative</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 Age \uf0b3 18 years at time of signing Informed Consent Form</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 Ability to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 Hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed per a positive PCR of any specimen (e.g., respiratory, blood, urine, stool, other bodily fluid) and evidenced by chest X-ray or CT scan</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 SpO2 \uf0a3 93% or PaO2/FiO2 \uf03c 300 mmHg</li>\n</ul><p>If a patient is on supplemental oxygen with SpO2 \uf03e 93%, but desaturation to \uf0a3 93% on lower supplemental oxygen or ambient air is documented during screening, the inclusion criterion is met.</p><ul>\n<li>\uf0b7 For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, as defined below:</li>\n</ul><p>Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \uf03c 1% per year during the treatment period and for 90 days after the final dose of study drug.

The interim looks will occur after roughly 111, 222, and 333 patients are enrolled, but all interims are subject to change depending on enrollment.

If the results of one of the interim analyses meets the pre-specified criteria for efficacy, further enrollment in the placebo arm will be discontinued and all enrolled patients will receive open-label TCZ.  At this point, efficacy will be</p><h2>Tocilizumab-F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd</h2><p>declared.

Specifically, the Lan-DeMets \uf061 -spending function that approximates the O'Brien-Fleming boundary will be applied to determine the critical value for stopping for positive efficacy at the interim analysis (DeMets and Lan 1994).  Interim analyses for efficacy will use the Fisher's exact test for difference in proportions and will utilize an O'Brien-Fleming alpha-spending function.  The efficacy boundaries for the z-scores at the four looks (three interim looks and final analysis) are 4.364, 2.986, 2.377, and 2.011 .</p><p>The critical value at the final analysis will be adjusted accordingly to maintain the protocolspecified overall type I error rate, per standard Lan-DeMets methodology.</p><p>The study management team will remain blinded unless the results meet the efficacy criteria. The interim efficacy analyses will be produced by a statistical programmer independent of the study management team and will reviewed by a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).</p><p>Full statistical details of the planned interim analyses, along with the rationale and timing will be documented in an interim statistical analysis plan, which will be made available to the relevant health authorities before the data snapshot for the first interim.</p><p>A Data Monitoring Committee will also evaluate safety according to policies and procedures detailed in a DMC Charter.

Thirtyone out of the 45 patients (69%) from the CTL019 series achieved a response (defined as being afebrile and off vasopressors for at least 24 hours within 14 days of the first dose of TCZ (maximum up to two doses) and without use of additional treatment other</p><p>than corticosteroids) within 14 days of the first dose of TCZ, and the median time from the first dose to response was 4 days.  Eight of the 15 patients (53%) from the axicabtagene ciloleucel series achieved a response, and the median time to response was 4.5 days.  The response rates were largely consistent among subgroups such as age group, sex, race, ethnicity, grade of CRS at first dose of TCZ, and duration of CRS prior to treatment with TCZ.  There were no reports of adverse reactions attributable to TCZ.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were available for 27 patients after the first dose of TCZ and for 8 patients after a second dose of TCZ.  Based on 131 PK observations, the geometric mean (% CV) maximum concentration of TCZ in the patients with CAR T cell induced, severe or life-threatening CRS was 99.5 \uf06d g/mL (36.8%) after the first infusion and 160.7 \uf06d g/mL (113.8%) after the second infusion.  The PK modeling analysis showed that patients with CRS had a faster clearance of TCZ than healthy volunteers and other patient populations, and simulations showed that exposure was considered acceptable with up to four doses of TCZ at least 8 hours apart in patients with CRS.</p><p>TCZ is also approved for CAR-T induced severe or life-threatening CRS in the European Union and certain other countries.</p></div>",

Based on the results of an initial 21-patient retrospective study in which patients with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia were treated with TCZ (Xu et al. 2020), an investigator-sponsored randomized, controlled trial (n = 188) has been initiated in the same population in China, testing the same TCZ dose regimen and is currently ongoing, with approximately 70 patients enrolled.  At present, the 21-patient publication (Xu et al. 2020) is the only published clinical data the Sponsor is aware of regarding the use of TCZ in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.</p><p>On 3 March 2020, TCZ was included in the seventh updated diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 issued by the China National Health Commission as one treatment option for severe or critical forms of COVID-19 pneumonia.  The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention defined disease severity according to the following criteria:</p><ul>\n<li>\uf0b7 Severe disease: dyspnea, respiratory frequency \uf0b3 30/min, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) \uf0a3 93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio (the ratio between the blood pressure of the oxygen [partial pressure of oxygen, PaO2] and the percentage of oxygen supplied [fraction of inspired oxygen, FiO2]) \uf03c 300 mmHg, and/or lung infiltrates \uf03e 50% within 24 to 48 hours; this occurred in 14% of cases.</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 Critical disease: respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) or failure (MOF); this occurred in 5% of cases (Wu et al. 2020).</li>\n</ul><p>Because body weight measurement is not always feasible in urgent circumstances, the dose regimen used in China is a single fixed dose of 400 mg TCZ IV (which equates to between 4 \uf02d 8 mg/kg based on the body weight range of the Chinese adult population), with the maximum single dose no more than 800 mg.  If clinical signs/symptoms do not improve, an additional dose can be administered after 12 hours.  The guidance advises that no more than two doses should be given.  TCZ treatment is not permitted for people with active infections including TB, bacterial, or fungal.</p><h2>Results from 21 Patients Treated with Tocilizumab in China</h2><p>In February 2020, twenty-one patients with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia were treated with TCZ IV (400 mg) plus standard of care.  The average age of the patients was 56.8 \uf0b1 16.5 years, ranging from 25 to 88 years.  Seventeen patients (81.0%) were assessed as severe and four (19.0%) as critical.  Most patients (85%) presented with lymphopenia.  C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were increased in all 20 patients (mean, 75.06 \uf0b1 66.80 mg/L).  The median procalcitonin (PCT) value was 0.33 \uf0b1 0.78 ng/mL, and only two of 20 patients (10.0%) presented with an abnormal value.  Mean IL-6 level before TCZ was 132.38 \uf0b1 278.54 pg/mL (normal \uf03c 7 pg/mL).</p><p>Standard of care consisted of lopinavir, methylprednisolone, other symptom relievers, and oxygen therapy as recommended by the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Sixth Edition).  All 21 patients had received routine standard of care treatment for a week before deteriorating with sustained fever, hypoxemia, and chest CT image worsening.</p><p>Eighteen patients (85.7%) received TCZ once, and three patients (14.3%) had a second dose due to fever within 12 hours.  According to the authors, after TCZ treatment, fever returned to normal and all other symptoms improved remarkably.  Fifteen of the 20 patients (75.0%) had lowered their oxygen intake and one patient needed no oxygen therapy.  CT scans showed significant remission of opacities in both lungs in 19/20 patients (90.5%) after treatment with TCZ.  The percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which was decreased in 85.0% of patients (17/20) before treatment (mean, 15.52 \uf0b1 8.89%), returned to normal in 52.6% of patients (10/19) on the fifth day after treatment.  Abnormally elevated CRP decreased significantly in 84.2% patients (16/19). No adverse drug reactions and no subsequent pulmonary infections were reported.</p><p>Nineteen patients (90.5%) were discharged at the time of the report, including two critical patients.  There were no deaths among the 21 treated patients.</p><p>The study authors concluded that TCZ is an effective treatment for patients with severe COVID-19 (Xu et al. 2020).</p></div>",

The exploratory biomarkers will be assessed to identify those patients who are most likely to respond to TCZ, to characterize TCZ mechanism of action, to provide further evidence of TCZ efficacy, and to understand progression of COVID-19.</p></div>",
