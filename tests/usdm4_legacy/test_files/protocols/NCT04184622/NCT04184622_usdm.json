These and other changes are listed in the below table.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Section # and Name</th><th>Description of Change</th><th>Brief Rationale</th></tr><tr><td>1.1. Synopsis 3. Objectives and Endpoints</td><td>Key secondary objective at 20 weeks was modified, changing heading from 'by dose' to 'pooled dose' analysis, and editing objective to reflect the pooled 10 mg and 15 mg doses.</td><td>Analysis of pooled data from participants on different tirzepatide doses is more appropriate as participants randomized to the 15-mg dose of tirzepatide will not be exposed to that dose until after Week 20.</td></tr><tr><td>1.1. Synopsis 3. Objectives and Endpoints</td><td>Key secondary objective at 72 weeks, by dose analysis, was modified:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>For the body weight objective, added the endpoint '\u226520% body weight reduction from randomization'.</td><td>To better inform clinical decisions in management of people living with obesity.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Deleted the objective and associated endpoint for SF-36v2 acute form Physical Functioning domain score for 10 mg and 15 mg separately.</td><td>Objective and associated endpoint were moved to Key secondary at 72 weeks, pooled dose analysis.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>CONFIDENTIAL</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Section # and Name</th><th>Description of Change</th><th>Brief Rationale</th></tr><tr><td>1.1. Synopsis 3. Objectives and Endpoints</td><td>Revised key secondary objective at 72 weeks from 'by dose' to 'pooled dose' analysis to demonstrate that the pooled 10 mg and 15 mg QWtirzepatide is superior to placebo for SF- 36v2 acute form Physical Functioning domain score.</td><td>To reduce the number of key secondary objectives.</td></tr><tr><td>1.1. Synopsis 3. Objectives and Endpoints</td><td>In the key secondary objective at 72 weeks, pooled dose analysis for tirzepatide (all doses combined) to demonstrate superiority to placebo for lipid parameters, the endpoint was modified to replace 'LDL' with 'non-HDL cholesterol', and to replace 'total' with 'HDL' cholesterol.</td><td>Emerging science indicates assessing HDL- cholesterol in addition to non-HDL cholesterol should provide more valuable data on CVD risk in this specific population.</td></tr><tr><td>1.1. Synopsis 3. Objectives and Endpoints</td><td>Additional secondary objective at 72 weeks, pooled dose analysis, the endpoint associated with lipid parameters was modified to replace 'HDL' with 'LDL' cholesterol, and to add 'total cholesterol'.</td><td>For consistency and to reflect the changes to the key secondary objectives.</td></tr><tr><td>4.1.1.2.3. Additional 2-Year Treatment Period for Participants with Prediabetes at Randomization (Visits 101 through 116)</td><td>Added wording 'unless diabetes had been diagnosed prior to the visits'.</td><td>For clarity.</td></tr><tr><td>4.1.2.2. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test</td><td>Added wording regarding use of OGTT for confirming diagnosis of diabetes.</td><td>For clarity and consistency with new text related to confirmation of diabetes diagnosis in Section 4.1.2.3.</td></tr><tr><td>4.1.2.3. Definition and Management of Incident Diabetes</td><td>Revised definition of incident diabetes and added subsections containing clarifying information related to 'Confirmation of diabetes diagnosis' and 'Recording of incident diabetes events'.</td><td>Definition of incident diabetes was revised to clarify the criteria regarding the requirement for 2 abnormal test results to confirm the diagnosis.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>CONFIDENTIAL</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Section # and Name</th><th>Description of Change</th><th>Brief Rationale</th></tr><tr><td>6.6.1. Tirzepatide</td><td>Added sentence allowing dose modification for management of participants with perceived excessive weight loss during the additional 2- year treatment period for participants with prediabetes at randomization.</td><td>To support patient management and retention in the additional 2-year treatment period.</td></tr><tr><td>6.6.3. Management of Participants with Perceived Excessive Weight Loss During the Additional 2-year Treatment Period for Participants with Prediabetes</td><td>Added this subsection containing information for managing participants with perceived excessive weight loss during the additional 2- year treatment period for participants with prediabetes at randomization.</td><td>Provide clear, detailed information for managing and retaining participants in the additional 2-year treatment period.</td></tr><tr><td>7.2. Participant Discontinuation/ Withdrawal from the Study</td><td>Added bullet point 'Female participants will be withdrawn from the study if the participant becomes pregnant.'</td><td>For clarity in participant management.</td></tr><tr><td>9.1. Statistical Hypotheses</td><td>Updated to reflect the changes specified in the key secondary objectives and endpoints in Section 3.</td><td>For consistency.</td></tr><tr><td>9.4.3.1. Primary Analyses</td><td>Updated information on estimands and related analyses.</td><td>To address and align with FDA feedback.</td></tr><tr><td>9.4.3.2. Key Secondary Analyses</td><td>Updated to reflect the changes specified in the key objectives and endpoints in Section 3.</td><td>For consistency.</td></tr><tr><td>9.4.4.4.2. Events Related to Potential Abuse Liability</td><td>Updated to replace current information with 'To identify AE terms suggestive of potential abuse liability, narrow terms fromSMQ of Drug abuse and dependence (20000101) will be used.'</td><td>Based on mechanism of action of tirzepatide, anticipated gastrointestinal adverse events, and low likelihood for abuse potential/psychoactive effects, it is reasonable to narrow the list of abuse terms used.</td></tr><tr><td>10.1.4. Committee Structure</td><td>Added wording pertaining to adjudication of incident diabetes events and cross-reference to related details in Section 4.1.2.3.</td><td>For clarity and consistency.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>CONFIDENTIAL</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Section # and Name</td><td>Description of Change</td><td>Brief Rationale</td></tr><tr><td>10.4. Appendix 4: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy Information</td><td>In subsection for 'Female Participants who become pregnant', modified final sentence to indicate that if a study participant becomes pregnant, the participant will discontinue study intervention 'and' will be withdrawn from the study.</td><td>For clarity and to align with other changes in protocol Section 7.2.</td></tr><tr><td>10.7. Appendix 7: ProtocolGPHK Standardized Protocols for the Measurement of Height, Weight, Waist Circumference, Vital Signs, Electrocardiogra m, and Oral</td><td>Added note in the text stating that placement of a venous cannula may not be required when a 2-hour OGTT is repeated to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes during the study, and only samples at 0 and 120 minutes for glucose measurement will be collected.</td><td>For clarity and to align with changes in Section 4.1.2.2.</td></tr><tr><td>Throughout</td><td>Used the term 'additional 2-year treatment period for participants with prediabetes at randomization' to replace similar but inconsistently used terms when referring to the study period following primary outcome at Visit 21 (Week 72).</td><td>For clarity and consistency.</td></tr><tr><td>Throughout</td><td>Minor, editorial and document formatting revisions.</td><td>Minor, therefore have not been summarized.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>CONFIDENTIAL</h2><h2>CONFIDENTIAL</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>7.</td><td>Discontinuation of Study Intervention and

Although loss of 5% to 10% body weight has been shown to reduce complications related to obesity and improve quality of life (Mertens and Van Gaal 2000; Knowler et al. 2002; Jensen et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014; Warkentin et al. 2014), lifestyle therapies fail to achieve sustainable weight loss in the majority of patients with obesity (Dombrowski et al. 2014).</p><p>The gut incretin hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1), are secreted after meal ingestion and mediate the incretin effect.  Both hormones have effects on endocrine cells in the pancreas, increasing insulin biosynthesis and secretion, and modifying glucagon secretion (Skow et al. 2016).  Based on these properties, several GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have been approved for pharmacological treatment of T2DM (Tomlinson et al. 2016).</p><p>In addition to its pancreatic effects, GLP-1R activation decreases gut motility, slows gastric emptying, and promotes satiety (presumably through a combination of GLP-1R activation in the central and peripheral nervous systems), thereby regulating food intake and body weight (Baggio and Drucker 2007).  The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approved the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity (SAXENDA\u00ae package insert, 2014; SAXENDA\u00ae SmPc, 2015).</p><p>Preclinical data indicate that GIP also exerts effects on appetite regulation and food intake, adipose tissue, and on peripheral energy metabolism.  Although studies evaluating effects of GIP on body weight have yielded equivocal results, GIP receptor (GIPR) activation may play a role in body weight regulation and targeting both the GLP-1R and the GIPR simultaneously may result in additive or synergistic effects of the 2 incretins on body weight (Coskun et al. 2018).</p><p>Tirzepatide is a 39-amino acid synthetic peptide dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist. Its structure is based on the GIP sequence and includes a C20 fatty diacid moiety. It is administered once-weekly (QW) by subcutaneous (SC) injection (Coskun et al. 2018).</p><p>As a dual GIP/GLP-1R agonist, tirzepatide could exceed the efficacy of selective GLP-1R agonists by recruiting metabolically active tissues not targeted by selective GLP-1R agonists (for example, adipose tissue as indicated by the observation of increased energy utilization) (Baggio and Drucker 2007) and has the potential to reach higher efficacy in target tissues, such as insulinproducing pancreatic beta cells that express both GIPR and GLP-1R, before reaching its therapeutic limitation.</p><p>Study I8F-MC-GPHK (GPHK; SURMOUNT-1) is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blinded study of the safety and efficacy of 5-mg, 10-mg and 15-mg tirzepatide QW, compared with placebo, when used in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management, in participants who do not have T2DM, and have obesity (BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 ) or are overweight (BMI \u226527 kg/m 2 ) with at least one weight-related comorbid condition (for example, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or cardiovascular disease).  All participants will be randomized to at least 72 weeks of treatment to study the effects on body weight reduction. Participants who have prediabetes will be studied for a total of 176 weeks of treatment to provide sufficient follow-up time to detect potential differences in progression to T2DM.</p><h2>Objectives

Activities</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Activity</th><th>Notes</th></tr><tr><td>Visit Fasting Visit</td><td>On all office visits, study participants should be reminded to report to the site before taking study drug (s) in a fasting condition, after a period of approximately 8 hours without eating, drinking (except water), or any significant physical activity. Since some screening procedures need to be completed in the fasting state, Visit 1 may be conducted over more than 1 day to ensure necessary conditions are met.</td></tr><tr><td>Visit 3</td><td>Baseline assessments must be completed before processing in the IWRS.</td></tr><tr><td>Visit 99 Visit 199</td><td>Participants wanting to discontinue the study before Week 72 will be asked to return for Visit 99 at 72 weeks \u00b1 7 days after randomization primarily for body weight measurement and assessment of adverse events. If the participant is unwilling to attend Visit 99, it should be documented in the participant medical record that the participant has refused to attend. Participants wanting to discontinue the study after Week 72 but before Week 176 will be asked to return for Visit 199 primarily for the body weight measurement and assessment of adverse events. Refusal to attend should be documented.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td>ED</td><td>Participants who are unable or unwilling to continue the study treatment for any reason will perform an ED visit. If the participant is discontinuing during an unscheduled visit or a scheduled visit, that visit should be performed as the ED visit.</td></tr><tr><td>Safety Follow-up Visits Visit 801 Visit 802</td><td>For participants who discontinue or complete the study within the first 72 weeks, Visit 801 (safety follow-up visit) should be performed 4 weeks after the last visit during the 72-week treatment period. Participants with prediabetes continuing to Week 78 should not perform Visit 801. For participants with prediabetes who complete the 176 weeks or discontinue after Week 72, Visit 802 should be performed 17 weeks after the last visit during the additional 2-year treatment period for participants with prediabetes at randomization.</td></tr><tr><td>Allowable Deviation (days)</td><td>The visit date is determined in relation to the date of the randomization visit (\u00b1 the allowed visit window).</td></tr><tr><td>Medical History</td><td>Medical history includes assessment of preexisting conditions (for example, history of gallbladder disease, cardiovascular disease, and medullary thyroid carcinoma) and substance usage (such as alcohol andtobacco).</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>Weight measurements should be obtained per the instructions in Section 10.7. Body weight must be measured in fasting state. If the participant is not fasting, the participant should be called in for a new visit within the visit window to have the fasting body weight measured.</td></tr><tr><td>Electrocardiogram</td><td>ECG measurements should be obtained per the instructions in Section 10.7. ECGs will be performed in triplicate at Weeks 0 and 36. All other ECGs will be single measurements. ECGs should be collected at least 30 minutes prior to collection of blood samples for laboratory testing, including PK samples.</td></tr><tr><td>Vital signs (3 sitting BP and HR)</td><td>Vital-sign measurements should be taken before obtaining an ECG tracing and before collection of blood samples for laboratory testing, per the instruction in Section 10.7.</td></tr><tr><td>Hand out diary, instruct in use</td><td>All training should be repeated as needed to ensure participant compliance.</td></tr><tr><td>Review study participant diary and study- drug compliance</td><td>Data from diary, as well as study drug compliance, should be reviewed.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td>Lifestyle Program instructions</td><td>Counselling on diet and exercise, to be performed by a dietician or equivalent qualified delegate, to include calculation of individualized energy requirement and methods to change dietary composition and amount of physical activity. The Lifestyle Program Instruction may be delivered on a separate day from the rest of that visit's study procedures but must occur within the visit window. Beginning at Week 8, the Lifestyle Program Instruction may be delivered by phone.</td></tr><tr><td>Review diet and exercise goals</td><td>All training should be repeated as needed to ensure participant compliance. Study personnel to provide reinforcement and encouragement for lifestyle modifications.</td></tr><tr><td>Injection training with Autoinjector demonstration device</td><td>All training should be repeated as needed to ensure participant compliance</td></tr><tr><td>Dispense study drug Visit 72</td><td>This applies only to those participants going into the additional 2-year treatment period for participants with prediabetes at randomization.</td></tr><tr><td>Observe participant administer study drug</td><td>Participants should administer their first dose of study drug at the end of the Visit 3, after other study procedures are completed</td></tr><tr><td>Serum pregnancy test</td><td>A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Visit 1 for women of childbearing potential only.</td></tr><tr><td>Urine pregnancy test</td><td>A urine pregnancy test must be performed at Visit 3 with the result available prior to randomization and first injection of study drug(s) for women of childbearing potential only. Additional pregnancy tests (beyond those required per the Schedule of Activities) should be performed at any time during the trial if a menstrual period is missed, there is clinical suspicion of pregnancy, or as required by local law or regulation.</td></tr><tr><td>Follicle-stimulating hormone test</td><td>Follicle-stimulating hormone test performed at Visit 1 for postmenopausal women at least 40 years of age with an intact uterus, not on hormone therapy, and who have had spontaneous amenorrhea for more than 1 year without an alternative medical cause.</td></tr><tr><td>2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (includes glucose, insulin, c-peptide)</td><td>2-hour OGTT testing should be omitted at visits following a protocol-defined diabetes diagnosis.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td>Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio Cystatin-c Calcitonin Hematology Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)</td><td>Screening visit assessment will be used to confirm eligibility.

Although loss of 5% to 10% body weight has been shown to reduce complications related to obesity and improve quality of life (Mertens and Van Gaal 2000; Knowler et al. 2002; Jensen et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014; Warkentin et al. 2014), lifestyle therapies fail to achieve sustainable weight loss in the majority of patients with obesity (Dombrowski et al. 2014).</p></div>",

Both hormones have effects on endocrine cells in the pancreas, increasing insulin biosynthesis and secretion, stimulating beta-cell neogenesis and proliferation, and protecting beta cells from apoptosis. They also exert actions on alpha cells, modifying glucagon secretion (Skow et al. 2016). Based on these properties, several GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have been approved for pharmacological treatment of T2DM (Tomlinson et al. 2016).</p><p>In addition to its pancreatic effects, GLP-1R activation decreases gut motility, slows gastric emptying, and promotes satiety (presumably through a combination of GLP-1R activation in the central and peripheral nervous system), thereby regulating food intake and body weight (Baggio and Drucker 2007). The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approved the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity (SAXENDA \u00ae package insert, 2014; SAXENDA\u00ae SmPc, 2015).</p><p>Preclinical data indicate that GIP exerts effects on appetite regulation and food intake, on adipose tissue and on peripheral energy metabolism.  Although studies evaluating effects of GIP on body weight have yielded equivocal results, GIP receptor (GIPR) activation may play a role in body weight regulation and targeting both the GLP-1R and the GIPR simultaneously may result in additive or synergistic effects of the 2 incretins on body weight (Coskun et al. 2018).</p><p>Tirzepatide is a 39-amino acid synthetic peptide with agonist activity at both the GIPR and GLP1R.  Its structure is based on the GIP sequence and includes a C20 fatty di-acid moiety (Coskun et al. 2018).  It is administered once weekly (QW) by subcutaneous (SC) injection. As a dual GIP/GLP-1R agonist, tirzepatide could exceed the efficacy of selective GLP-1R agonists by recruiting metabolically active tissues not targeted by selective GLP-1R agonists (for example, adipose tissue as indicated by the observation of increased energy utilization) (Baggio and Drucker 2007) and has the potential to reach higher efficacy in target tissues that express both GIPR and GLP1R.</p><p>Study I8F-MC-GPHK (GPHK, SURMOUNT-1) is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blinded study, to investigate the safety and efficacy of 5-mg, 10-mg, and 15mg tirzepatide QW, compared with placebo, when used in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for body weight management in participants who do not have T2DM and have obesity (BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 ) or are overweight (BMI \u226527 kg/m 2 ) with at least one</p><p>weight-related comorbid condition (for example, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or cardiovascular disease). All participants will be randomized to at least 72 weeks of treatment to study the effects on body weight reduction. Participants who have prediabetes at randomization will be studied for a total of 176 weeks of treatment to provide sufficient follow-up time to assess the effects of tirzepatide on progression to T2D and on long-term body weight changes.</p></div>",

With the exception of orlistat, a drug that blocks absorption of dietary fat, many current obesity treatments work primarily by stimulating regions of the brain to promote satiety.  Weight loss induced by GLP-1R agonists appears to be mediated through a combination of hormonal inputs to satiety centers (van Bloemendaal et al. 2014) and has not been consistently associated with changes in mental health or with potential for addiction in long-term studies conducted to establish cardiovascular safety in patients with diabetes (Marso et al. 2016a, Marso et al. 2016b, Gerstein et al. 2019).  Tirzepatide, which is both a GLP-1R and GIPR agonist, has been associated with significant dose-dependent weight loss at 5-, 10- and 15mg doses in Phase 2 studies (Frias et al. 2018).</p><p>Dose selection for obesity treatment has been informed by 3 clinical trials: a Phase 1 study, Study I8F-MC-GPGA (GPGA), and two Phase 2 studies, Study I8F-MC-GPGB (GPGB) and I8F-MC-GPGF (GPGF).</p><p>Phase 1 Study GPGA was a combination of single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies in healthy subjects and a multiple dose study in patients with T2DM . A total of 142 participants (89 healthy subjects and 53 patients with T2DM) received at least 1 dose of treatment.  Doses of tirzepatide ranged from:</p><ul>\n<li>\uf0b7 0.25 mg to 8 mg in the SAD (with maximum tolerated dose achieved at 5 mg)</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 multiple doses from 0.5 mg to 4.5 mg QW and titrated doses up to 10 mg QW for 4 weeks in healthy subjects</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 multiple doses at 0.5 mg and 5 mg QW and titrated up to 15 mg QW for 4 weeks in patients with T2DM in the MAD</li>\n</ul><p>The safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles of tirzepatide at doses and escalation regimens administered in this Phase 1 study supported further development of tirzepatide for QW dosing in patients with T2DM.</p><p>Phase 2 studies GPGB and GPGF studies provided initial safety, tolerability and efficacy data in the tirzepatide 1-to-15-mg dose range when used in treatment of patients with T2DM.  In the dose range of 5 to 15 mg, tirzepatide provided significantly greater reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg QW.  The most common AEs, which were also dose dependent, were mild to moderate nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  Study GPGF showed that adjustments in the tirzepatide dose-escalation algorithm resulted in additional reductions in the frequency of GI AEs and reduced the frequency of treatment discontinuations due to GI AEs.</p></div>",

            "text": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Tirzepatide is a 39-amino acid synthetic peptide with agonist activity at both the GIPR and GLP1R.  Its structure is based on the GIP sequence and includes a C20 fatty di-acid moiety (Coskun et al. 2018).  It is administered QW by SC injection.</p><p>As a dual GIP/GLP-1R agonist, tirzepatide could exceed the efficacy of selective GLP-1R agonists by recruiting metabolically active tissues not targeted by selective GLP-1R agonists (for example, adipose tissue as indicated by the observation of increased energy utilization) (Baggio and Drucker 2007) and has the potential to reach higher efficacy in target tissues, such as insulinproducing pancreatic beta cells that express both GIPR and GLP-1R, before reaching its therapeutic limitation.  Results from a Phase 2 study (GPGB) demonstrated that tirzepatide use in participants with T2DM was associated with a substantial, dose-dependent weight loss, greater than the weight change observed with dulaglutide, a specific GLP-1R agonist.  General safety characteristics of all studied doses of tirzepatide were similar to that of the GLP-1R agonist class, consisting mainly of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  In general, these events were transient and mild or moderate in severity, with few severe episodes.  Although GI AEs were more common at the 15-mg arm of tirzepatide, this dose demonstrated the highest efficacy in terms of weight loss.</p><p>This suggests that tirzepatide has the potential to become a medication for chronic weight management. An optimized dose escalation regimen, proposed in the Study GPHK (SURMOUNT-1) to improve tolerability (and supported by a dose-escalation algorithm from study GPGF), should enable a use of higher doses to maximize effects on body weight.  Study GPHK (SURMOUNT-1) is designed to determine the comparative benefits and risks of</p><p>tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg QW versus placebo in participants who have obesity or are overweight.  A double-blind design was selected to minimize participant and investigator bias in assessments for efficacy, safety, and study drug tolerability.</p><p>A placebo comparator was selected for this trial in accordance with regulatory guidance (FDA 2007; EMA 2016).  In addition, all participants, regardless of treatment assignment, will receive lifestyle modification counselling consistent with current guidelines for weight management (Jensen et al. 2013).  Specifically, participants will consult with a dietician, or equivalent qualified delegate, throughout the study to achieve at least a 500 kcal/day energy deficit through a combination of caloric restriction and increased physical activity (Section 5.3.1).  The planned duration of treatment for the primary endpoint at 72 weeks allows for at least a 52-week treatment period at the dose achieved following dose escalation to either 5, 10, or 15 mg.  This duration is considered appropriate to assess the full effects and benefit/risk of each maintenance dose of tirzepatide compared with placebo on body weight and is consistent with regulatory guidelines (FDA 2007; EMA 2016).</p><p>The effects of drug cessation will be assessed in the 4-week and in the 12-week safety followup/observational periods</p><p>Another objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of tirzepatide on the risk of new-onset diabetes.  Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing T2DM and diabetes prevention is of a great importance in obese subjects to protect them from complications of the disease. Several studies have shown that interventions leading to weight loss may help prevent diabetes (Adams et al. 2017, le Roux et al. 2017).</p><p>To obtain additional information regarding the rate of conversion to diabetes on tirzepatide, participants with prediabetes diagnosed at the beginning of the study (being at increased risk of diabetes), will be treated and observed for an additional 2 years.  Based on available literature, the 3 years of treatment with tirzepatide should be sufficient to demonstrate the risk reduction of developing T2DM compared to placebo.  This additional treatment period would also permit collecting data on the durability of weight changes with long-term therapy and safety of longterm tirzepatide treatment.</p><p>To minimize the potential confounding effect of changes to concomitant medications, participants will be permitted to use concomitant medications that do not interfere with the assessment of efficacy or safety characteristics of the study treatments.</p></div>",

The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized 5-item instrument for use as a measure of health outcome.  It provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as population health surveys.  The EQ-5D-5L comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression).  The 5L version, introduced in 2005, scores each dimension at 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, unable to perform/extreme problems), for a total of 3125 possible health states.  In addition to the health profile, a single health-state index value can be derived based on a formula that attaches weights to each of the levels in each dimension.

The participant should be followed until the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained.  The frequency of follow-up evaluations of the AE is left to the discretion of the investigator.</p><p>Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect.</p><p>After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record via eCRF the occurrence and nature of each participant's preexisting conditions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study.

Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 when a condition related to the drug delivery system necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude either permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, the serious outcome of 'required intervention' will be assigned.</li>\n</ul><p>All AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF and assessed for serious criteria.  The SAE reporting to the Sponsor begins after the participant has signed the ICF and has received IP.  However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving IP, the SAE should be reported to the Sponsor per SAE-reporting requirements and timelines (see Section 8.3.1) if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure.</p><p>Study-site personnel must alert Lilly or its designee of any SAE within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the event via a sponsor-approved method.  If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be immediately followed with official notification on study-specific SAE forms.  This 24hour notification requirement refers to the initial SAE information and all follow-up SAE information. Participants with a serious hepatic AE should have additional data collected using the eCRF.</p><p>Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal exposure to IP) does not meet the definition of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported following the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus.</p><p>Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in subjects once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the participant disposition case report form [CRF] has been completed).  However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he or she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify Lilly.</p><h2>Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator identifies as related to IP or procedure.  United States 21 CFR 312.32, European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, and the associated detailed guidance or national regulatory requirements in participating countries require the reporting of SUSARs.  Lilly has procedures that will be followed for the identification, recording, and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global regulations and the associated detailed guidance.</p></div>",

            "text": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Acute pancreatitis is defined as an AE of interest in all trials with tirzepatide, including this trial. Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas that may also involve peripancreatic tissues and/or remote organ systems (Banks and Freeman 2006).  The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires 2 of the following 3 features:</p><ul>\n<li>\uf0b7 abdominal pain, characteristic of acute pancreatitis (generally located in the epigastrium and radiates to the back in approximately half the cases) (Banks and Freeman 2006; Koizumi et al. 2006); the pain is often associated with nausea and vomiting);</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 serum amylase (total and/or pancreatic) and/or lipase \u22653X ULN</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</li>\n</ul><p>If acute pancreatitis is suspected, appropriate laboratory tests (including levels of pancreatic amylase and lipase) should be obtained via the central laboratory (and locally, if needed). Imaging studies, such as abdominal CT scan with or without contrast, MRI, or gallbladder ultrasound, should be performed.  Abdominal ultrasound may be used as an alternative method only if CT and MRI cannot be performed. If laboratory values and/or abdominal imaging support the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, the participant must discontinue therapy with</p><p>tirzepatide, but will continue in the study. A review of the participant's concomitant medications should be conducted to assess any potential causal relationship with pancreatitis.</p><p>Each AE of pancreatitis must be reported.  If typical signs and/or symptoms of pancreatitis are present and confirmed by laboratory values (lipase or amylase [total and/or pancreatic]) and imaging studies, the event must be reported as an SAE.  For a potential case that does not meet all of these criteria, it is up to the investigator to determine the seriousness of the case (AE or SAE) and the relatedness of the event to study drug(s).</p><p>Each participant will have measurements of p-amylase and lipase (assessed at the central laboratory) as shown on the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) to assess the effects of the investigational doses of tirzepatide on pancreatic enzyme levels.  Serial measurements of pancreatic enzymes have limited clinical value for predicting episodes of acute pancreatitis in asymptomatic participants (Nauck et al. 2017; Steinberg et al. 2017a, 2017b).  Thus, further diagnostic follow-up of cases of asymptomatic pancreatic hyperenzymemia (lipase and/or pancreatic amylase \u22653X ULN) is not mandated but may be performed based on the investigator's clinical judgment and assessment of the participant's overall clinical condition. Only cases of pancreatic hyperenzymemia that undergo additional diagnostic follow-up and/or are accompanied by symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis will be submitted for adjudication.</p><p>All suspected cases of acute or chronic pancreatitis will be adjudicated by an independent clinical endpoint committee.  In addition, AEs of severe or serious abdominal pain of unknown etiology will also be submitted to the adjudication committee to assess for possible pancreatitis or other pancreatic disease. Relevant data from participants with acute or chronic pancreatitis and those with severe or serious abdominal pain will be entered into a specifically designed eCRF page. The adjudication committee representative will enter the results of adjudication in a corresponding eCRF page.</p></div>",

Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.</li>\n</ul><h2>Contraception Guidance:</h2><p>Contraceptive use by men and women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.</p><h2>CONFIDENTIAL</h2><p>Two forms of effective contraception, where at least 1 form is highly effective, will be used. Effective contraception may be used as the second therapy.  Barrier protection methods without concomitant use of a spermicide are not a reliable or acceptable method.  The use of male and female condoms as a double barrier method is not considered acceptable due to the high failure rate when these methods are combined.</p><h2>Highly Effective Methods of Contraception:</h2><ul>\n<li>\uf0b7 Combined oral contraceptive pill and mini pill</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 NuvaRing</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 Implantable contraceptives</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 Injectable contraceptives (such as Depo-Provera \u00ae )</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 Intrauterine device (such as Mirena \u00ae and ParaGard \u00ae )</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 Contraceptive patch - ONLY women &lt;198 pounds or 90 kg</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 Total abstinence (if this is their preferred and usual lifestyle) or in a same-sex relationship with no sexual relationship with males (as part of their preferred and usual lifestyle), and agrees to maintain this status throughout trial follow-up</li>\n</ul><p>Note: periodic abstinence (for example, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, and postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence just for the duration of a trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception</p><ul>\n<li>\uf0b7 Vasectomy - for men in clinical studies</li>\n</ul><p>Note : Implantable contraceptives and injectable contraceptives (such as Depo Provera) are only permitted if started more than 18 months prior to screening.

Periodic abstinence (for example, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, and postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence just for the duration of a trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.</p><h2>CONFIDENTIAL</h2><p>Men with pregnant partners should use condoms during intercourse for the duration of the study and until the end of estimated relevant potential exposure in women of childbearing potential.</p><p>Men who are abstinent (if this is complete abstinence, as their preferred and usual lifestyle) or in a same-sex relationship (as part of their preferred and usual lifestyle) must agree to either remain abstinent or stay in a same-sex relationship without sexual relationships with females (usual lifestyle).  In these situations, men are not required to use contraception.</p><p>Men should refrain from sperm donation for the duration of the study and for 5 half-lives of study drug plus 90 days after the last dose of study drug, corresponding to 4 months after the last injection.</p><h2>Collection of Pregnancy Information</h2><h2>Male participants with partners who become pregnant</h2><ul>\n<li>\uf0b7 The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant's female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this study.</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner's pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.</li>\n</ul><h2>Female Participants who become pregnant</h2><ul>\n<li>\uf0b7 The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in this study.

Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.</li>\n<li>\uf0b7 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE.  A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any poststudy pregnancy-related SAE considered reasonably related to the study intervention by the investigator will be reported to the Sponsor as described in Section 8.3.2.  While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>\uf0b7 Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will discontinue study intervention and be withdrawn from the study.</li>\n</ul></div>",
