CD38 functions as a receptor binding to CD31 and is involved in cell adhesion and signal transduction. CD38 is also an ecto-enzyme catalyzing the synthesis and hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine-diphosphate-ribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to adenosine diphosphate-ribose (2). Adenosine diphosphate-ribose can be further converted into adenosine, a multifunctional immunosuppressive nucleoside that binds to different specific receptors expressed by immune effector cells (3).</p><p>The expression of CD38 in healthy humans can be detected on natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, granulocytes, activated T and B cells, and plasma cells. Several hematological malignancies express CD38 including those of B-lymphocyte, T-lymphocyte and myeloid origin. Moreover, in some solid tumors, such as prostate cancer and glioblastoma, CD38 expression has been shown. See Section 2.1 for additional information on biological functions of CD38 and its role in tumor microenvironment.</p><h2>Programmed cell death 1 protein pathway</h2><p>The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been known for decades (4). The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control (5). The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD-1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an immunoglobulin superfamily member related to cluster of differentiation 28 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (programmed cell death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] and/or programmed cell death-ligand 2 [PD-L2]). The structures of murine PD-1 alone (6) and in complex with its ligands were first resolved (7, 8) and more recently the nuclear magnetic resonance-based structure of the human PD-1 extracellular region and analyses of the interactions with its ligands were also reported (9).</p><p>Programmed cell death 1 protein and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an immunoglobulin Variable-type domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM). Following T cell stimulation, PD-1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules, such as CD3\u03b6, PKC\u03b8 and ZAP70, which are involved in the CD3 T cell signaling cascade (10). The mechanism by which PD-1 down-modulates T cell responses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA-4 (11). Programmed cell death 1 protein was shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes, including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, regulatory T cells and NK cells (12). Expression has</p><p>also been shown during thymic development on CD4-CD8- (double negative) T cells (13) as well as subsets of macrophages (14) and dendritic cells (15). The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types (16). PD-L1 is expressed at low levels on various non-hematopoietic tissues, most notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen-presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments (16). Both ligands are Type I transmembrane receptors containing both immunoglobulin variable- and immunoglobulin constant-like domains in the extracellular region and short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs. Binding of either PD-1 ligand to PD-1 inhibits T cell activation triggered through the T cell receptor. Programmed cell death-ligand 2 is thought to control immune T cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T cell function in peripheral tissues. Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T cell inhibitor (17, 18) which, via its interaction with the PD-1 receptor on tumor-specific T cells, plays a critical role in immune evasion by tumors (19). As a consequence, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in cancer (20).</p><p>Five anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab, are now approved in multiple indications including HCC and SCCHN (21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29).</p></div>",

Therefore, isatuximab monotherapy cohort will be initiated in patients with glioblastoma upon positive signal of isatuximab and atezolizumab combination Phase 2 Stage 2.

            "text": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma is a rising cause of cancer related deaths worldwide (29). The leading cause of HCC is associated with chronic hepatitis B (33%), alcohol (30%) or hepatitis C (21%) (33). The majority of HCC patients are detected at an advanced or end stage (13). Systemic treatment options for advanced disease are limited with sorafenib being the only approved effective standard of care in the first line unresectable advanced setting. The objective RR (1 to 3%) is minimal and survival benefit (6.5 to 10.7 months versus 4.2 to 7.9 months with placebo) is modest in both Caucasian and Asian population (34, 35). Recently, lenvatinib, another vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor, has demonstrated similar survival benefit to sorafenib (13.6 months versus 12.3 months) in a Phase 3 study (36). The FDA has accepted a supplemental new drug application for lenvatinib as a frontline systemic treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in September 2017. For patients who were able to tolerate sorafenib but subsequently progressed on sorafenib, regorafenib has been approved based on an overall survival (OS) benefit compared with placebo (10.6 months versus 7.8 months) (3). In September 2017, nivolumab received accelerated approval from the FDA in patients who have been previously treated with sorafenib, supporting the use of immunotherapy for treatment of HCC in the second-line setting.</p><p>HCC is an immunogenic tumor in an immunotolerant environment.  The chronic inflammatory conditions in the liver (eg, cirrhosis, hepatitis B virus (HBV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection) contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through T cell exhaustion, with presence of PD-1 expressing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in HCC lesions, supporting the use of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade as a therapeutic strategy (14, 2, 37). Multiple anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (including pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and durvalumab) are being developed, as a monotherapy or in combination, for treatment of patients with HCC. In the Phase 1/2 study CheckMate040, nivolumab achieved a RR of 14% (central review using RECIST 1.1) in the 145 patients who received sorafenib. More importantly, responses were observed irrespective of HCC etiology or PD-L1 expression. The response was durable (9.9 months) and most disease stabilizations lasted at least 6 months. The safety profile observed in patients with advanced HCC was generally similar to that observed in patients with other cancers, with the exception of a higher incidence of elevations in transaminases (18% Grade 3/4 aspartate aminotransferase [AST], 11% Grade 3/4 alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) and bilirubin (7% Grade 3/4 bilirubin) levels. Immune-mediated hepatitis requiring systemic corticosteroids occurred in 5% of patients. US FDA accelerated approval was granted based on this study (2).</p><p>Durvalumab, a human immunoglobulin G1 antibody targets PD-L1, also demonstrated some clinical activity in patients with HCC (could be positive for HBV or HCV) with a RR of 10% and similar median OS as nivolumab (13.2 months, as of Oct 2016). The most common Grade 3/4 TEAE was elevation in transaminases (7.5% AST and 5.0% ALT). Although the preliminary results are encouraging, most patients with HCC do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors monotherapy.</p><p>The current study (ACT15377) will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and RRs of isatuximab in combination with atezolizumab as primary objective, in patients with unresectable HCC who progressed on/after or are intolerant to sorafenib.</p></div>",

First-line palliative treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN is platinum-based system therapy. Adding cetuximab to cisplatin/carboplatin plus 5-fluorouracil followed by maintenance cetuximab improves RR from 20% to 36%, and survival from 7.4 months to 10.1 months (16). For the patients who have cancer progression within 6 months after platinum-based chemotherapy administered in the context of primary or recurrent disease, the prognosis is poor.

More than 60% of patients with ovarian cancer are diagnosed with advanced (stage III-IV) disease, the</p><p>mainstay of treatment for which is upfront surgical cytoreduction followed by adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Bevacizumab is approved (excluding the United States) as a first-line treatment in combination with standard chemotherapy (40). Platinum-based therapy (plus bevacizumab) continues to be the principal regimen used to treat platinum-sensitive tumors (defined as relapse at least 6 months after completion of last platinum-based therapy). However, platinum resistance eventually occurs in virtually all patients with recurrent EOC, as response usually lasts for only a few months and with each subsequent course of therapy the treatment free interval shortens until the disease is declared 'platinum-resistant' (defined as progression within 6 months of platinum-based therapy) or 'platinum-refractory' (defined as progression during or within 4 weeks after the last dose) (32).</p><p>For the patients who harbor mutations in the genes encoding breast cancer type 1 and 2 susceptibility protein (BRCA1 and BRCA2), which occur in 10-15% of ovarian cancers, poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are transforming the treatment landscape (41). The first PARP inhibitor, olaparib is approved as a maintenance therapy in germline BRCA-mutated patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent disease based on a randomized Phase 3 study (PFS 19.1 months versus 5.5 months) (42).</p><p>Commonly used treatments in the setting of recurrent platinum-resistant EOC nowadays include pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), paclitaxel (weekly) and topotecan (40, 43). These single agent chemotherapies were reported to result in PFS of 3-4 months, OS of about 12 months, and RRs ranging from 10% to 15% (32). Management of recurrent platinum-resistant EOC remains challenging due to toxicities associated with cytotoxic agents and emergent of drug resistance.</p><p>Studies have shown that EOC, particularly those of high-grade serous, is most likely associated with pattern of adaptive immune resistance and may be more likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (44, 45). Immune checkpoint inhibitors are being extensively tested in the clinic for treatment of recurrent EOC. To date, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy have demonstrated similar RRs and PFS as single agent chemotherapy in platinum-resistance disease in small Phase 1/2 studies (46, 47, 48). However, durable responses were noted with avelumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab which created enthusiasm as durable responses are atypical in this setting. A randomized Phase 3 study evaluating avelumab in combination with PLD in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer is currently underway (49).</p><p>The current study (ACT15377) will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and RRs of isatuximab in combination with atezolizumab as primary objective, in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory recurrent EOC, who received no more than 3 lines of systemic therapy for platinum-sensitive disease and no prior therapy for platinum-resistant/refractory disease (specific to France: see Appendix 8 in Section 10.8.1).</p></div>",

Treatment of newly diagnosed GBM consists of maximal safe surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy with concurrent and maintenance temozolomide. Adding temozolomide improves median PFS to 6.9 months and OS to 14.6 months (51). Only 10% of patients survive longer than 5 years. O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene methylation status identifies patients most likely to benefit from the addition of temozolomide (52).</p><p>At tumor progression, treatment options are scarce and of poor effectiveness. Lomustine is one of the commonly used treatments for recurrent GBM with an OS of &lt;8.6 months, RRs of 4-5%, and PFS rate at 6 months of 8-19% (median PFS &lt;2 months) (53, 54, 55). Bevacizumab was approved by the US FDA for treatment of recurrent GBM based on RRs of 20-26% in two Phase 2 studies (25, 26). However, the improved RRs of bevacizumab did not translate into meaningful OS (&lt;10 months versus &lt;8.6 months for lomustine). It has been hypothesized that the pseudoresponse of bevacizumab is attributed to its normalization effect as an anti-angiogenic agent which interferes with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) interpretation during disease assessment (21).</p><p>Glioblastoma multiforme is recognized as an immunosuppressive neoplasm due to activation of various immune escape mechanisms including the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Upregulation of PD-L1 expression was detected in &gt;70% of recurrent GBM tumor specimens, along with sparse-to-moderate density of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (22). Contrary to conventional belief where immune responses were limited in the brain due to the blood brain barrier (BBB), the BBB has selective permeability for immune cells regulating the brain microenvironment. Glioblastoma cells are also known to release factors that disrupt the BBB, permitting infiltration of activated macrophages and lymphocytes (23, 24). Tumor-specific immune memory response has been demonstrated in orthotopic immunocompetent murine glioblastoma model where treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors including anti-PD-1/PD-L1 led to long-term survival. In particular, increased activated CD8+ and natural killer cells, decreased suppressive immune cells were observed in the tumor microenvironment and draining cervical lymph nodes (56). Multiple clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as a monotherapy or in combination for treatment of recurrent GBM. Although in the Phase 3 CheckMate 143 study, single agent nivolumab did not improve OS in patients with recurrent GBM compared to bevacizumab (9.8 versus 10 months), durable response was observed with nivolumab (DoR 11 versus 5.3 months) (30). CD38 protein expression was observed in glioblastoma biopsies, suggesting that addition of anti-CD38 therapy to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 may potentiate tumor-specific immune response (see Section 2.1).</p></div>",

It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.</p><h2>c) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization:</h2><p>In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether 'hospitalization' occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.</p><p>Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.</p><h2>d) Results in persistent disability/incapacity:</h2><ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.</li>\n</ul><h2>e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</h2><ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: 'f) ';\">Other situations:</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.</li>\n</ol><p>Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.</p><h2>RECORDING AND FOLLOW-UP OF AE AND/OR SAE</h2><h2>AE and SAE recording</h2><ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.

At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.</p><p>Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter &lt;10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with \u226510 to &lt;15 mm short axis), as well as non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.</p><p>Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential</p><h2>Special considerations regarding lesion measurability:</h2><h2>\u00b7 Bone lesions:</h2><ul>\n<li>-Bone scan, positron emission tomography scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions,</li>\n<li>-Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above,</li>\n<li>-Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.</li>\n</ul><h2>\u00b7 Cystic lesions:</h2><ul>\n<li>-Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts,</li>\n<li>-'Cystic lesions' thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.</li>\n</ul><h2>\u00b7 Lesions with prior local treatment:</h2><ul>\n<li>-Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other locoregional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.</li>\n</ul><h2>Method of assessment</h2><p>All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.</p><p>The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging based evaluation should always be performed rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical examination.</p><ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and \u226510 mm diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may be reviewed at the end of the study.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">Chest X-ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progression is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. Measurability of lesions on CT scan is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of measurement. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">Cytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by protocol.</li>\n</ul><h2>Baseline documentation of 'target' and 'non target' lesions</h2><p>When more than 1 measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.</p><p>Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.</p><p>Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of \u226515 mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis \u226510 mm but &lt;15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis &lt;10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.</p><p>A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.</p><p>All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as 'present', 'absent', or 'unequivocal progression'. In addition,</p><p>it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case (eg, 'multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes' or 'multiple liver metastases').</p><h2>Response criteria</h2><p>Response criteria are described in Table 12.</p><table><caption><div class=\"caption\">Table 12 - Response criteria</div></caption><tbody><tr><th>Response criteria</th><th>Evaluation of target lesions</th></tr><tr><td>CR</td><td>Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.</td></tr><tr><td>PR</td><td>At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</td></tr><tr><td>PD</td><td>At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression).</td></tr><tr><td>SD</td><td>Neither sufficient shrinkage from the baseline study to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Abbreviations: CR=complete response; PD=progressive disease; PR=partial response; SD=stable disease.</p><h2>Special notes on the assessment of target lesions</h2><p>Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded and should be measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination, even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the 'sum' of lesions may not be zero even if CR criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of &lt;10 mm. For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.</p><p>Target lesions that become 'too small to measure': All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being 'too small to measure'. When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on the eCRF. If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned.</p><p>When non-nodal lesions 'fragment', the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the 'coalesced lesion'.</p><h2>Evaluation of non-target lesions</h2><p>While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol.</p><ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">CR: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis).</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '\u00b7 ';\">Progressive Disease: Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression).</li>\n</ul><p>The concept of progression of non-target disease requires additional explanation as follows:</p><p>When the patient also has measurable disease; in this setting, to achieve 'unequivocal progression' on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest 'increase' in the size of 1 or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.</p><p>When the patient has only non-measurable disease; to achieve 'unequivocal progression' on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening such that the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest 'increase' in the size of 1 or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition: if all lesions are truly non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% increase in 'volume' (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from 'trace' to 'large', an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in protocols as 'sufficient to require a change in therapy'. If 'unequivocal progression' is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point.</p><h2>New lesions</h2><p>The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression. The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some 'new' bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting lesions). This is particularly important when the patient's baseline lesions show PR or CR. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a 'new' cystic lesion, which it is not.</p><p>Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential</p><p>A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases. The patient's brain metastases are considered to constitute PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.</p><p>If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents new disease. If repeat scans confirm that there is a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.</p><p>While fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:</p><ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: 'A) ';\">Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: 'B) ';\">No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:</li>\n<li>-If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD,</li>\n<li>-If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG PET scan). If the positive FDG PET at follow-up corresponds to a preexisting site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of anatomic images, this is not PD.</li>\n</ol><h2>Evaluation of best overall response</h2><p>Time point response: At each protocol-specified time point, a response assessment should occur. Table 13 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who have measurable disease at baseline.</p><table><caption><div class=\"caption\">Table 13 - Response in patients with target disease</div></caption><tbody><tr><th>Target lesions</th><th>Non-target lesions</th><th>New lesions</th><th>Overall response</th></tr><tr><td>CR</td><td>CR</td><td>No</td><td>CR</td></tr><tr><td>CR</td><td>Non-CR/non-PD</td><td>No</td><td>PR</td></tr><tr><td>CR</td><td>Not evaluated</td><td>No</td><td>PR</td></tr><tr><td>PR</td><td>Non-PD or not all evaluated</td><td>No</td><td>PR</td></tr><tr><td>SD</td><td>Non-PD or not all evaluated</td><td>No</td><td>SD</td></tr><tr><td>Not all evaluated</td><td>Non-PD</td><td>No</td><td>Inevaluable</td></tr><tr><td>PD</td><td>Any</td><td>Yes or No</td><td>PD</td></tr><tr><td>Any</td><td>PD</td><td>Yes or No</td><td>PD</td></tr><tr><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Yes</td><td>PD</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Abbreviations: CR=complete response; PD=progressive disease; PR=partial response; SD=stable disease.</p><p>When patients have non-measurable (therefore non-target) disease only, Table 14 is to be used.</p><table><caption><div class=\"caption\">Table 14 - Response in patients with non-target disease only</div></caption><tbody><tr><th>Non-target lesions</th><th>New lesions</th><th>Overall response</th></tr><tr><td>CR</td><td>No</td><td>CR</td></tr><tr><td>Non-CR/non-PD</td><td>No</td><td>Non-CR/non-PD</td></tr><tr><td>Not all evaluated</td><td>No</td><td>Inevaluable</td></tr><tr><td>Unequivocal PD</td><td>Yes or No</td><td>PD</td></tr><tr><td>Any</td><td>Yes</td><td>PD</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Abbreviations: CR=complete response; PD=progressive disease; PR=partial response; SD=stable disease.</p><p>Missing assessments and inevaluable designation: When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not evaluable (NE) at that time point.</p><p>If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time point response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD. When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is NE at that time point.</p><p>If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time point response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD.</p><h2>Special notes on response assessment</h2><p>When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to 'normal' size (&lt;10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of 'zero' on the eCRF.</p><p>In trials where confirmation of response is required, repeated 'NE' time point assessments may complicate best response determination. The analysis plan for the trial must address how missing data/assessments will be addressed in determination of response and progression. For example, in most trials it is reasonable to consider a patient with time point responses of PR, -NE, and -PR as a confirmed response.</p><p>Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 'symptomatic deterioration'. Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stopping study therapy.</p><p>The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non target disease. For equivocal findings of progression (eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.</p><h2>Duration of response</h2><p>The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or PD is objectively documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded on study).</p><p>The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.</p><p>Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD).</p><p>Reproduced from: Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J et al.
